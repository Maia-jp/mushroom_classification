# Mushroom

## Introduction
Mushrooms are used for a wide variety of purposes, from medicine to food. This wide variety of purposes lead both scientists and amateurs to "hunt" them in the wild. This hunting can be challenging, especially for amateurs, since it is hard to identify eatable mushrooms. 

This wide variety of mushrooms also rise a lot of great questions such as "What are the key characteristics of poisons mushrooms ?". This notebook aims to explore those amazing creatures and provide insights. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook was taken from [Keaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). In this dataset, we have a wide variety of mushroom samples with their 23 characteristics.
